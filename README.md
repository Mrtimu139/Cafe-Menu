# Cafe-Menu
This project is a simple HTML and CSS implementation of a cafe menu website named "Camper Cafe."
The webpage includes sections for coffee and desserts, with corresponding images and prices for each item. The design features a warm color scheme, custom fonts, and a background image of coffee beans. 
The layout is responsive, and the code is organized with a focus on readability and maintainability. The project also includes a footer with a link to the cafe's website and address information.
 The project is open-source and free to use, following a "No Copyright" policy, and is attributed to freeCodeCamp.org.
 I created this project during the training section of the freeCodeCamp.org course by solving problems. It is one of the best-guided courses I have ever encountered. They teach us through problem-solving and project development, granting permission to add the projects to our GitHub and LinkedIn profiles. It's truly a blessing for beginner developers.
